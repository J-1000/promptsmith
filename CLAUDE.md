When building the UI check if the implementation is correct in the following way:
1. run: npx expo start --web
2. run: node scripts/screenshot.js http://localhost:8081 screenshot.png
3. read the screenshot with the Read tool to check the UI

## Please make frequent, really atomic commits.

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
